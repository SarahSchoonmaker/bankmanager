Bank Manager:

This Python Bank Management project is a terminal application prompting the user to select from a list of options to open an account, make a deposit or withdrawal, 
add change to the balance, transfer money between multiple accounts, change their pin number, and exit the program. Run python BankManager.py from the terminal to
start the program.
